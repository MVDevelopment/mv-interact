mv-interact is a lightweight and flexible interaction menu for FiveM servers.
It provides a simple way to create interaction points that players can use to trigger actions such as opening menus, spawning vehicles, accessing garages, or running custom events.

The script is designed to be easy to use, highly configurable, and developer-friendly, making it a solid base resource for other scripts.

⚠️ Notes

This script is often used as a dependency for other resources (e.g. PD garages, shops, job scripts).
Make sure it is started before scripts that rely on it.
